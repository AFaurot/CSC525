          "context": "DON’T LET INVASIVE SPECIES RUIN YOUR FAVORITE FISHING SPOT Aquatic nuisance species (ANS) are a significant and rapidly growing threat to Colorado’s fisheries and water supplies. ANS are invasive animals, plants and diseases that are not native to our rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. Once introduced, most ANS cannot be eradicated and cost millions to manage. Preventing the introduction and spread of ANS is critical to maintaining our fisheries. Learn more about aquatic nuisance species at cpw.state.co.us/aquatic-nuisance-species. Threats to Colorado’s aquatic ecosystem and fisheries include zebra and quagga mussels, New Zealand mudsnails, whirling disease, viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) and Eurasian watermilfoil. Help CPW combat these invasive species and prevent new ANS from entering our state by following the guidelines outlined below: 1. It is the responsibility of the vessel or other floating device operator to clean, drain water from all compartments and motors/engines between launches, and dry the vessel or other floating device in between launches. 2. Upon removal of a vessel or other floating device from waters of the state, and before leaving the boat launch or parking area, the operator is required to remove aquatic plants and water drain plug(s). It is prohibited to transport a vessel or other floating device over land with aquatic plants or water drain plugs in place. 3. Remove all plants, animals or mud, and thoroughly wash boats, trailers, waders and equipment that have come in contact with the water before leaving a lake or stream. 4. Drain any space or item that could hold water, including live wells, bait containers, bilge, ballast tanks, storage areas, engine cooling systems or any other place on boats or equipment that might hold water. 5. Allow boats, engines, boots and gear to dry completely before moving to other waters. 6. If draining and drying are not possible, wash boats, trailers and equipment carefully and completely with hot water (120–140 degrees F). 7. Stop by the CPW office in Denver (6060 Broadway, Denver, CO 80216) Monday–Friday for a free professional ANS inspection or decontamination. Check cpw.state.co.us/boat-inspections for more than 70 statewide inspection station hours of operation. 8. Don’t move or transport fish between water bodies. This can spread diseases and nuisance species. 9. Don’t dispose of fish entrails or other byproducts into any body of water.  ANS STAMP: Required for motorboats and sailboats To help CPW detect, prevent and manage aquatic nuisance species in Colorado's waters, and to protect human health, safety and welfare from aquatic nuisance species, each motorboat or sailboat must have an ANS stamp before launching in Colorado waters. Boat owners are required to purchase the ANS Stamp, and boat operators must retain proof of purchase (an electronic or printed receipt) on their person, motorboat or sailboat when operating the vehicle. - RESIDENTS: Boaters registering in Colorado will purchase the ANS Stamp at the time of registration, renewal online, or at any CPW office or state park. Residents with motorboats or sailboats documented by the U.S. Coast Guard or otherwise exempt from in-state registration can purchase the ANS stamp online at  cpw.state.co.us/buy-apply, or in person at any CPW office, state park or sales agent. - NONRESIDENTS: Nonresidents can purchase the ANS stamp online at cpw.state.co.us/buy-apply, or in person at any CPW office, state park or sales agent",

Crayfish can be taken for personal consumption, but care should be taken with their use and disposal. - Even though crayfish can be taken live east of the Continental Divide, it is recommended that the tails of all crayfish be removed immediately and packed in ice for transport. - Do not throw unused bait crayfish, or bait of any kind, back in the water alive. LIVE TRANSPORT PROHIBITED  FROM WATERS WEST OF THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE All crayfish caught west of the Continental Divide must be immediately killed (by removing the head from the thorax) and taken into possession, or immediately returned to the water from which they were taken. AT SANCHEZ RESERVOIR SWA Rusty crayfish have been discovered at Sanchez Reservoir State Wildlife Area (SWA) in Costilla Co.
